I am a PhD student in Actuarial Science at the Sapienza University of Rome.  

I am working under the supervision of Professor Gian Paolo Clemente and Professor Munir Hiabu.

My research interests are:

* Predictive models for non-life insurance with applications to loss reserving.
* (Re)insurance pricing.
* Survival analysis.

I enjoy programming and try to develop open source tools for practitioners and academics alongside my research.
