I am a Postdoc in the Section of Biostatistics, at the Department of Public Health of the University of Copenhagen.

You can contact me at name(dot)surname(at)sund(dot)ku(dot)dk.

My research interests are:

* Survival analysis.
* Prediction models.
* Actuarial models for non-life insurance: loss reserving and (re)insurance pricing.

I enjoy programming and try to develop open source tools for practitioners and academics alongside my research.
