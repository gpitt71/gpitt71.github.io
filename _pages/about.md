I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Turin.

My research interests are:

* Survival analysis.
* Prediction models.
* Actuarial models for non-life insurance: loss reserving and (re)insurance pricing.

I enjoy programming and try to develop open source tools for practitioners and academics alongside my research.
